# /deploy -- no web deploy

**OpenCredentials has no web deploy.** Its README on GitHub -- https://github.com/mindattic/OpenCredentials -- is the project page. To update the project page, edit `README.md` and push to `main`.

The README-driven landing page `mindattic.com/OpenCredentials.htm` was retired together with MindAttic.Deploy's catalog mode (amendment DEP-A6 in `MindAttic.Deploy/docs/AMENDMENTS.md`, 2026-10-03). `npm run deploy -- --only OpenCredentials` is now rejected, so do not run MindAttic.Deploy for this project.

When invoked, tell the user the above and stop.
